## Abstract of paper
The binary Kob-Andersen (KA) Lennard-Jones mixture is the standard model for computational studies of viscous liquids
and the glass transition. For very long simulations, the viscous KA system crystallizes, however, by phase separating 
into a pure A particle phase forming a fcc crystal. We present the thermodynamic phase diagram for KA-type mixtures 
consisting of up to 50% small (B) particles showing, in particular, that the melting temperature of the standard KA 
system at liquid density 1.2 is 1.028(3) in A particle Lennard-Jones units. At large B particle concentrations, the 
system crystallizes into the CsCl crystal structure. The eutectic corresponding to the fcc and CsCl structures is cutoff 
in a narrow interval of B particle concentrations around 26% at which the bipyramidal orthorhombic PuBr3 structure is 
the thermodynamically stable phase. The melting temperature’s variation with B particle concentration at two constant 
pressures, as well as at the constant density 1.2, is estimated from simulations at pressure 10.19 using isomorph 
theory. Our data demonstrate approximate identity between the melting temperature and the onset temperature below which 
viscous dynamics appears. Finally, the nature of the solid-liquid interface is briefly discussed.
